## About

Over 15 years of research & teaching experience in some of North Americas top research universities and recipient of numerous prestigious academic awards during graduate and postdoctoral training. Continuing research interests include molecular genetics of the physiological stress (HPA axis) stress response in early childhood and investigating early childhood neurodevelopmental risk for mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc. Additional research experience also included forensic DNA work in trace and touch DNA analysis, infection and immunity work in biohazard level 4 containment and biosafety procedure development. Over 32 publications (over 750 citations and h-index of 15) in some of the fields top peer-reviewed journals.
